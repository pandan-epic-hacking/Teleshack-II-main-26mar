Simple TMX Library documentation
********************************

This library reads and writes the Tiled TMX format in a simple way.
This is useful for map editors or generic level editors, and it's also
useful for using a map editor or generic level editor like Tiled to
edit your game's levels.

To load a TMX file, use "tmx.TileMap.load()".  You can then read the
attributes of the returned "tmx.TileMap" object, modify the attributes
to your liking, and save your changes with "tmx.TileMap.save()".
That's it!  Simple, isn't it?

At the request of the developer of Tiled, this documentation does not
explain in detail what each attribute means. For that, please see the
TMX format specification, found here:

http://doc.mapeditor.org/reference/tmx-map-format/


tmx.TileMap
===========

class tmx.TileMap

   This class loads, stores, and saves TMX files.

   version

      The TMX format version.

   orientation

      Map orientation.  Can be "orthogonal", "isometric", "staggered",
      or "hexagonal".

   renderorder

      The order in which tiles are rendered.  Can be ""right-down"",
      ""right-up"", ""left-down"", or ""left-up"".  Default is
      ""right-down"".

   width

      The width of the map in tiles.

   height

      The height of the map in tiles.

   tilewidth

      The width of a tile.

   tileheight

      The height of a tile.

   staggeraxis

      Determines which axis is staggered.  Can be "x" or "y".  Set to
      "None" to not set it.  Only meaningful for staggered and
      hexagonal maps.

   staggerindex

      Determines what indexes along the staggered axis are shifted.
      Can be "even" or "odd".  Set to "None" to not set it. Only
      meaningful for staggered and hexagonal maps.

   hexsidelength

      Side length of the hexagon in hexagonal tiles.  Set to "None" to
      not set it.  Only meaningful for hexagonal maps.

   backgroundcolor

      The background color of the map as a hex string (e.g. ""FF0000""
      or ""#00FF00""), or "None" if no background color is defined.

   nextobjectid

      The next available ID for new objects.  Set to "None" to not set
      it.

   properties

      A list of "Property" objects indicating the map's properties.

   tilesets

      A list of "Tileset" objects indicating the map's tilesets.

   layers

      A list of "Layer", "ObjectGroup", and "ImageLayer" objects
      indicating the map's tile layers, object groups, and image
      layers, respectively.  Those that appear in this list first are
      rendered first (i.e. furthest in the back).

classmethod TileMap.load(fname)

   Load the TMX file with the indicated name and return a "TileMap"
   object representing it.

TileMap.save(fname, data_encoding='base64', data_compression=True)

   Save the object to the file with the indicated name.

   Arguments:

   * "data_encoding" -- The encoding to use for layers.  Can be
     ""base64"" or ""csv"".  Set to "None" for the default encoding
     (currently ""base64"").

   * "data_compression" -- Whether or not compression should be used
     on layers if possible (currently only possible for base64-encoded
     data).
