[Beat]So what is our next goal?[AN]
[MidLeft]
We need to pass through[N]
the Black Forest.[AN]
[Beat]Unfortunatly, Cidor already[N] 
has forces there.[AN]
[MidRight]
Doesn't sound like anything we haven't[N]
dealt with before.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Well, apparently the empire has[N]
been recruiting from nearby villages.[AN]
It seems like popular opinion is[N]
turning against us[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I wish I could say I'm suprised.[AN]
Maybe deciding to work with Radnitz[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
We've been over this.[AN]
[Beat]In addition, [Red]allegedly some empire[N]
veterans will be arriving soon.[AN]
We'll need to hurry.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Red][Beat]What will stop them[N]
from pursuing us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
There is a gate[N]
within the forest.[AN]
If we pass through[N]
and seal it behind us,[AN]
we should be able to[N]
buy ourselves time to escape.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]It'll have to do.[N]
Let's go join the others.[A][X]

[Beat]There they are.[N]
The Liberators.[AN]
[Beat]I don't trust these[N]
empire goons.[A] Can what they[N]
say really be true?[AN]
