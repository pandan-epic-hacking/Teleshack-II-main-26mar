Huff[Beat][....] Huff[Beat][....] I think-[....] I think[N]
we're clear of them.[A]
[FarLeft]
We're just lucky Boro had a[N]
change of heart when he did[Beat][A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
How are you feeling General?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Hah, it'll take more than this[N]
to put me out of commission.[N]
But I have to say, thank you all,[AN]
normally I would reprimand[N]
this kind of foolishness but-[....][N]
you've done a fine job.[A]
[FarLeft]
We're not exactly out of the[N]
woods so I wouldn't thank[N]
us yet, this place is a maze.[A]
[Left]
Of course, no doubt every soldier[N]
Cidor has is after us.[N]
Do we have an escape plan?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Not exactly but I think[N]
Varga might know.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

[Right][ThreeLineBox]
If we can get through here,[N]
we should be able to[N]
make a break for it.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
You're sure about this Varga?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Not exactly, there will[N]
be plenty of guards.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You're sure we can trust this guy[N]
Cleo? I mean he was awful keen[N]
to turn on his former allies.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
I'm certain, trust me on this.[N]
I'll explain it all later.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah, I trust you, alright then.[N]
Well I think no matter what we do[N]
we're going to run into soldiers,[AN]
so I don't see anything wrong[N]
with Varga's proposal. General?[A]
[Left]
If we can get the drop on them we[N]
should be able to push through[N]
before they can react,[AN]
but we'll have to be fast if we[N]
want everyone to escape. Of course[N]
that should be no trouble for us.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Alright then, if theres no[N]
objections, lets move.[A][X]

[MidLeft]
Thats not the point! What if[N]
we hadn't come this way?[AN]
You'd be rotting in Cidors jail[N]
for the rest of your days.[AN]
And I don't think you'd be any[N]
use to us like that![A]
[Right]
Yeah but we aren't and[N]
thats what matters![A]

the recon squad[Beat][CloseEyes][A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
I mean you need someone who can[N]
handle themselves in a brawl.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]

toe to toe with a knight in a[N]
one versus one swordfight.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
And we're two for[N]
the price of one![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][OpenEyes]

could slip out from under[N]
me just like that?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
But of course, how[N]
hard could it be?[A]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Hmph.[......][OpenEyes] Your blasted rebellion[N]
has been a thorn in my side[AN]
long enough.[....] I'm putting an[N]
end to this pointless conflict[AN]
here and now,[....] today.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Cidor! Don't you see the[N]
harm this is doing to our[N]
country? Why do you-[A]
[MidLeft]
Enough of your political drivel,[N]
you don't even understand what[N]
you're fighting against. I do[AN]
what I must for Decia.[A]
[FarRight]
Even if that amounts to killing[N]
your own countrymen? Letting[N]
Cythes stomp all over us?[AN]
Just that you might become[N]
their favourite pet?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You know nothing of what[N]
I work towards, why I do this.[N]
