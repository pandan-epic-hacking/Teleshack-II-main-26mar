Meanwhile, in Gechrysos,[N]
the heart of Cythes...[A][X]

## Ch5xKwameGoesDown
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
Loewe! Cleo! We have[N]
arrived at the island![A][X]

## Ch5xLoeweCleoTalk
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, we'll arrive at the base in[N]
an hour. We should prepare ourselves.[N]
[Beat]You seem out of it. What is it?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I was just thinking about the past.[N]
We've worked together for a couple years[N]
now, yeah? Feels like a lifetime has passed.[A]
[MidRight]
Indeed. When I defected from Cythes,[N]
you and Dragana alone welcomed me.[N]
I have much to thank both of you for.[A]
[MidLeft]
Honestly, I didn't know what to think[N]
at first. A highborn woman walks in[N]
and wants to join a rebellion[Beat][AN]
Sounds like the setup to a bad joke.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
H-Highborn?[.4] To be clear,[N]
I am not a noble of any kind.[A]
[MidLeft]
Even so, you're no commoner either.[N]
I may be curious about your past[Beat][AN]
But at the end of the day, you're an[N]
ally and a friend. That's enough for me.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe[Beat] When our work is done,[N]
I can tell you what you wish to know.[N]
However, I do have one condition.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh, what's that?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
You have to do the same.[N]
Is that acceptable?[A]
[MidLeft]
Well, there's not much to say[Beat][N]
but alright. I'll take you up on that.[A]
[MidRight]
Excellent. For now, we must both[N]
survive until that day comes.[A][X]


## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraAlive
[MidLeft][LoadKwame][OneLineBox]
Well, another time, then[Beat][A]
[Event]
[MidRight][LoadMira][TwoLineBox]
Hold a moment, Kwame.[N]
Why were you watching them?[A]
[MidLeft]
I intended to discuss our plans with[N]
them, but it seemed rude to interrupt.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Not a bad excuse for what looked like[N]
spying, but it won't work. I was House[N]
Selese's spymaster before Cidor's betrayal.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Twelve years ago, then. And this event[N]
drove you into the rebellion's arms?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Right. I heard that two knights of House[N]
Freyse planned to organize a rebellion,[N]
and with that, my path was set.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
General Dragana[Beat] We are all worse[N]
off for her loss. My condolences.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hmph[Beat] flattery won't gain you trust.[N]
You know nothing of our struggles, and[N]
we know nothing of your background.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
...A fair point. Then I'll have to[N]
allow my strategies to show my loyalty.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Better hope they do. If I see any hint[N]
of treachery, I'll root it out without[N]
remorse. Mercy is a luxury we don't have.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
As you should, Captain.[N]
I respect your dedication.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That's all I wanted[N]
to say. I'll be off.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace][Event]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It is fortunate that those two have a[N]
watchful, if abrasive, guardian. I'm sure[N]
they'll rely on her in the days to come.[AN]
The rebels may be only embers, but united,[N]
even sparks can form an inferno. Let us[N]
hope this growing flame is not doused[Beat][A][X]


## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraDead
[MidLeft][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I intended to discuss our future[N]
strategic plans, but interrupting[N]
them would be callous indeed.[AN]
I doubt they desire the sympathy of[N]
an outsider like myself. Still,[N]
the Liberators' bonds are heartening.[AN]
The rebels may be only embers, but united,[N]
even sparks can form an inferno. Let us[N]
hope this growing flame is not doused[Beat][A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting1
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[Right]
Well, here we are. Elmhurst Island isn't[N]
much, but it helps us keep a low profile.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Right. We know the paths well enough[N]
and have traps set all over the island.[N]
Even if occupation forces found us,[AN]
they would perish before escaping.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Well, a large part of that is Trajan[Beat][N]
That guy's a monster and a half.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Trajan?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
The man on the shore there. For now,[N]
let us hurry and dock the boat. The[N]
reserve unit is waiting for us.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting2
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Loewe, Cleo! I'm glad to see the two of[N]
you made it out alive. Where's Dragana?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Trajan, she[Beat] was imprisoned by Cidor.[N]
We almost made it out, but Cidor[N]
struck her down at the last second.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Really? Just like that, huh[Beat][N]
That dastard[Beat] He'll pay for this.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Our rescue mission failed, so the[N]
consequences lie on our shoulders.[N]
I will accept the blame-[A]
[MidLeft]
There's no point in assigning fault now.[N]
We just have to continue her legacy.[N]
[Beat]Still, what happened out there?[AN]
Last I heard, the main unit planned to[N]
attack a supply line connecting[N]
Selese and General Elias's forces.[A]
[FarRight]
Boro left our group in favor of Cidor,[N]
leaving a leadership vacuum in his wake.[N]
Then, we were ambushed by Selese forces.[A]
[MidLeft]
We lost our leader, and even Boro[N]
abandoned us[Beat] One founder dead,[N]
and the other a traitor. Good grief[Beat][A]
[Right]
He also helped us escape Cidor's manse.[N]
Honestly, I'm not sure what side[N]
he's on now, or if he's even alive.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hm[Beat] And Mira?[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraAlive
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[MidRight][LoadMira]
Did you think I was gone? Don't worry,[N]
I won't die. Not until Decia is free.[A]
[MidLeft]
Well, that's a relief. If I were[N]
the only founder left of the four,[AN]
that'd be quite a burden to carry.[N]
I'm glad that you made it back, Mira.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraDead
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
She[Beat] perished in the rescue[N]
attempt. We erred in our tactics.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Even Mira has fallen? That means I'm[N]
the last of the four founders left[Beat][N]
It seems your mission failed completely.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I can't argue that point.[N]
If I had just reacted a second[N]
sooner, then maybe[Beat] Mira[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
No, I apologize. That you two lived[N]
is a miracle itself. I shouldn't have[N]
expected anything more from you.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraCaptured
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
She[Beat] was captured in the rescue[N]
attempt. We erred in our tactics.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That means I'm the last of the[N]
four founders who can fight[Beat][N]
It seems the mission didn't go well.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I can't argue that point.[N]
We lost one of our best fighters.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No, at the very least, she may still[N]
be alive. We'll just have to rescue[N]
her at the earliest opportunity.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Right. That's all we can do now[Beat][A][X]


## Ch5xTrajanMeeting4
[FarLeft][LoadKwame]
[Left][LoadTrajan]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[Left][OneLineBox]
And who is this man you're with?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, my apologies. I am Kwame, a[N]
strategist who seeks to halt the[N]
Cythean advance. For that purpose,[AN]
I paid for this vessel, and its[N]
crew have decided to work with[N]
us after a Selesian attack.[A]
[Left]
You have my gratitude, then. Had you[N]
not intervened, I'm not sure when[N]
these two would have made it back.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I will accept it with honor. Loewe spoke[N]
quite highly of you before our approach.[A]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Ha, did he now? I'm glad to hear it.[N]
Care to see my might firsthand, Loewe?[A][ToggleSmile]
[Right]
[Beat]Sorry, Trajan, but we don't have[N]
time for a spar. Kwame can fill you in.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Alright, we'll postpone it til later.[N]
You two, take the boat around the back![N]
I'll lead the way back to headquarters.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting5
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Hmm[Beat] Best we use the war room for[N]
any important planning. Follow me![A][X]


## Ch5xStrategyRoom
[FarLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see. It looks like the Cythean offense[N]
is more dire than I thought. What do[N]
you three think our next move should be?[A]
[Left]
The obvious target is Selese.[N]
Their location provides the[N]
Cytheans with a foothold in Decia.[AN]
If we take that position ourselves,[N]
we'll gain more recruits out of Selese's[N]
citizens and rid ourselves of Cidor.[A]
[Right]
After our escape, I am certain Cidor will[N]
ask for aid. If General Elias intervenes,[N]
we have no chance of claiming victory.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Well then, what's your suggestion?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Seeking out Mahemen could give us[N]
more information about the weapons,[AN]
and informing Chouwouj of the emperor's[N]
ambitions may yield new allies.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
We can't rely on the promises of[N]
Chouwouj's warlords without their king,[AN]
and we can't afford to sail west now.[N]
The journey to Mahemen is long, and its[N]
deserts are arduous. Being gone too long[N]
will risk losing even more Decian land.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
I believe you both have valid points,[N]
but Cleo is correct about Chouwouj.[AN]
Whispers abound that a survivor of the[N]
royal family is beginning to act.[AN]
[Left]
Acting based off rumors seems[N]
unwise[Beat] Any ideas, Trajan?[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yes, well[Beat] You spoke of[N]
the axe of Decia, correct?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Indeed. What of it?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I was a knight of House Freyse once.[N]
There's an old tale of an ancient[N]
axe stored beneath the ground,[AN]
passed down from lord to heir.[N]
It's possible that is what you seek.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
If so, why would the former lord[N]
not have used it against Cythes?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
His forces were outnumbered ten to one.[N]
No weapon could bridge that gulf,[N]
even if he could have unearthed it.[A]
[Left]
I hadn't thought of it, but Freyse was[N]
the highest Decian house before the fall.[N]
A connection to the axe seems plausible.[A]
[FarLeft]
There's one more important detail.[N]
Last week, I received a report[N]
on rebel activity in Freyse.[AN]
It appears that Joakim's heir survived,[N]
along with an army prepared for war.[A]
[Right]
Then it seems our course is clear.[N]
If we leave this heir to their[N]
own devices, they may perish.[A]
[FarRight]
Very true. Even if we cannot find the[N]
axe, House Freyse has many followers[N]
even now that may fight for our cause.[A]
[Left]
It's settled, then. We'll sail back[N]
east and make our way to Freyse.[N]
Trajan, will you come with us?[A]
[FarLeft]
Unfortunately, I have to protect the[N]
base. That being said, I can lend you[N]
[Red]two[Red] members of our reserve corps.[AN]
I'm sure that they'll prove useful.[A]
[Right]
Thank you. Loewe, we should go survey[N]
the potential recruits. Kwame, do you[N]
mind waiting for us to choose?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Not at all. Please choose wisely.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Talk to me when you're done,[N]
and I'll get the boat ready.[A]
[Right]
My thanks. Now, let us see these[N]
volunteers for ourselves[Beat][A][X]

you how bored I was of waiting[AN]
in the barracks for weeks,[N]

Yeah, you've spent all that time[N]
pestering me while I'm busy.[N]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
She looks to carry a lance, which we[N]
don't have many users of. In addition,[N]
her pegasus can fly. If one of us is[Beat][AN]
unable to help, she could fight[N]
in the skies in our stead,[N]

And her actual combat skills?[A]

hardly scratch ol' Buck here.[A]

Varga[Beat] I'm glad you survived[N]

[MidLeft]
We have much to talk about,[N]
but not in front of him.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I'm sorry, Loewe. Could you step[N]
away for a moment? Varga is...[N]
friend of mine from Cythes.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Is he an enemy of Decia?[A]
[MidLeft]
No. I am only an ally of Cleo.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Then who you are is none of my[N]
business. I'll be around, so[N]
talk to me when you're done.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Right]
Well, now that he is gone, you need[N]
hold nothing back. Why were you[N]
masquerading as a Selesian guard?[A]
[MidLeft]
Your brother asked me to investigate[N]
your disappearance, as he believed that[N]
the story of your death was unlikely.[A]
[Right]
Well, I suppose that's reason enough[N]
to look for me, but again, why were[N]
you there during our mission?[A]
[MidLeft]
I heard of the general's capture and a[N]
new tactician that used many Cythean[N]
maneuvers. I simply connected the dots.[AN]
Besides, your defection is unsurprising.[N]
Loyalty to family kept you to your duties,[N]
but everyone has a breaking point.[A]
[Right]
Can you blame me? This occupation is[N]
unjust! Emperor Orfeas commands[N]
that we take over the continent,[AN]
and anyone who challenges us[N]
is lucky to keep their lives,[N]
let alone their homes or food.[A]
[MidLeft]
Then what of your brother? He leads this[N]
[OpenQuote]unjust" occupation and answers to the[N]
emperor. What do you think drives him?[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I do not know. Growing up, I thought[N]
that Elias knew everything, and if I only[N]
followed the path he laid out for me,[AN]
I too could be of service to my country.[N]
Now, I can scarcely stomach the notion,[N]
but what does he see that I cannot?[A]
[MidLeft]
There is always more than meets the[N]
eye, my student. The people do not[N]
follow Orfeas due to power alone.[AN]
Everyone is ruled by something higher[N]
than a single man. Fear, greed, hope[Beat][N]
These ideals are what they see, Cleo.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I have much to contemplate,[N]
but now that you have found me,[N]
what do you intend to tell Elias?[A]
[MidLeft]
That you are alive and number among[N]
the rebels. I already sent a letter[N]
while we were in Port Neufchatel.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
What now? Will you return to Cythes?[A]
[MidLeft]
No. Elias asked that I protect you.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
I see[Beat] Thank you, Varga. I am[N]
counting on your service, as always.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hmph. First, we'll need to start your[N]
training over again. You've grown[N]
soft after joining these rebels.[A]

Uh, perhaps we can delay that-[A]

No, not particularly. Cleo, you mind if[N]
I talk to this guy alone? I've got some[N]

the record, you're the last person who[N]
should talk about hiding things, Kwame.[A]
[MidLeft]
Ah, my apologies. In Mahemen, I knew a[N]
woman that reminds me of you, with[N]
bladework sharper than a lion's fang.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]You spent time in Mahemen, then.[N]
Do you recognize this sword? It belonged[N]
to my mother before Cythes invaded.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It is difficult to believe that any[N]
commoner could have such a blade.[N]
Who exactly were your parents, Loewe?[A]
[Right]
My father studied Mahemeni history, but[N]
my mother didn't speak much of her past.[N]
Her peerless swordplay was the only hint.[A]
[MidLeft]
A scholar, eh? I suppose that is how[N]
you knew of the Book of Havarti.[N]
And what is your mother's name?[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Catrin. Does that ring any bells?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]The name does feel familiar,[N]
but I can't place it at the moment.[N]
Age dulls the mind, I suppose.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Hmph. If you won't answer,[N]
then you've only wasted my time.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hold a moment. There is[N]
one thing I can tell you.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Spit it out, then.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That blade doesn't appear to be one of[N]
the four blessed weapons. However[Beat][N]
it does have some kind of enchantment.[AN]
Carry it with caution, Loewe.[A]
[Right]
I'll keep that in mind.[N]
If you remember anything[N]
else, let me know.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Catrin, your son has inherited that[N]
fiery disposition of yours. Further,[N]
that blade[Beat] I'm certain of it now.[AN]
It interferes with the Halaka Suhaja's[N]
ability to detect Byelen's blessings.[N]
Is this chance, or something more[Beat][A][X]

## Ch5xMiraIskraTalk
[FarLeft][LoadMira]
[Left][LoadIskra]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[FarLeft]
Oh, you two. Have we[N]
decided on our next move?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
The heir of Freyse has returned and[N]
leads an army to reclaim their home.[N]
We decided to assist their effort.[A]
[Left]
House Freyse[Beat] It's a shame that[N]
General Dragana couldn't live to see[N]
the day that we'd help free it.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
All we can do now is make[N]
sure her death isn't in vain.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Agreed. We owe her that much.[N]
Still, I have to admit that[N]
I'm curious about this heir.[AN]
Before today, we knew nothing[N]
of them, save their existence.[N]
Lord Joakim was cautious, indeed.[A]
[Left]
Whatever they're like, I just hope we[N]
can get along. With Freyse by our side,[N]
defeating Cidor would be much easier.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Selese, eh? After we deal with this[N]
mission, they'll be our next target.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Perhaps, but liberating Freyse may[N]
open up other options. The day we free[N]
Selese from its chains is uncertain.[A]
[FarLeft]
True enough. Well, either way, I'll[N]
continue to support the two of you.[N]
Iskra, you will too, right?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Of course. Someone has to make sure[N]
Loewe doesn't get in over his head.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Well, it's a little late for that, but[N]
I appreciate the thought. Make sure[N]
you watch out for yourself too, Iskra.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
You don't need to worry about me.[N]
I'm way stronger now, right?[A]
[Right]
You're not as weak, so from[N]
a certain point of view, sure.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
If you think that, then hurry up[N]
and teach me all your sword skills.[N]
With that, I'll surpass you easily.[A]
[Right]
Fine, I'll show you a bit more once[N]
we set out. Don't complain if it's[N]
too much for you, though.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Don't worry, it won't be.[A][ToggleSmile]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
If that's all[Beat] Loewe, we[N]
should return to our duties.[A]
[Right]
Right. I'll see you later, Iskra.[N]
Mira, we'll be counting on you as usual.[A]
[FarLeft]
You got it, boss.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][Right][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
So you managed to convince him, huh?[N]
You could've just asked me, Iskra.[N]
I know how to use a sword just as well.[A]
[Left]
Sure, but Loewe's sword style is different[N]
from any Decian discipline. It'd be useful[N]
to have more than one user of it, right?[A]
[FarLeft]
Well, fair enough. We'll need all the[N]
firepower we can get to take back[N]
Freyse and defeat Cidor for Dragana.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Cidor[Beat] you used to[N]
work for him, right?[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Before his betrayal, yes.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
And my father is a Selesian[Beat][N]
I don't remember him very well, though.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Do you want to know who he is?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
No, I don't. If he's still on their[N]
side, then he's my enemy. The only[N]
family that matters to me is you,[AN]
Loewe, and everyone else in the[N]
Liberators. They're all I need.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'm happy to hear that, but if you[N]
ever change your mind[Beat] I'll tell[N]
you. That's a promise, Iskra.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Thank you, Mom. Really[Beat][N]
for everything you've done.[A][X]

Our spar can wait til I get back.[A]
[MidLeft]
Fair enough. Loewe, Cleo, I've got one[N]
piece of advice for you before[N]
you head out. Care to hear it?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Of course, Commander Trajan.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If these divine weapons are all they're[N]
cracked up to be, then Kwame's not wrong[N]
that they're important. However,[AN]
wars are won with strategy and manpower.[N]
No matter what kind of secret weapons[N]
they are, our path to victory is the same:[AN]
Fight like hell, and come back alive.[A]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
You don't have to tell me twice![N]
I'll take out enough Cytheans for[N]
the both of us, Trajan. Count on it.[A]
[MidLeft]
I'll hold you to it. Now, better get[N]
a move on! Give the heir my apologies[N]
for not being able to be there myself.[A][ToggleSmile]

Phew[Beat] quite the trek from Decia,[N]
but I finally made it. I never thought[N]
the emperor would call me to Gechrysos,[AN]
not when Decia is unstable. [OpenQuote]Meet in the[N]

that I'm glad you're with me, Nerube![A]

Halt! Who's[Beat] Sir Elias?![N]

Sorry, but that's on a need-to-know[N]
basis. I'm afraid that's all I can say.[A][ToggleSmile]

Please tell us in the future[N]
before doing this again, sir.[N]
For security reasons, we must-[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Honestly[Beat] I don't remember raising[N]
you to fly into the emperor's palace.[N]
You couldn't just take the front door?[A]
[MidRight]
I didn't want to waste any of His[N]
Majesty's time, Father. Well, if you're[N]
here, then he called for you as well?[A]
[MidLeft]
Indeed. None of the other knights are[N]
here, however. They all have duties[N]
in other territories[Beat] Tell me, Elias.[AN]
Have you heard any news of Cleo?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]No, not yet. I sent Varga to search[N]
for her, but I've heard no word since.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see. I thought that being stationed[N]
in Decia, under your watch, may help[N]
her acclimate to military life[Beat][AN]
but Decia is too dangerous, no matter[N]
her talent. I failed her as a father.[A]
[MidRight]
Cleo's tougher than you think, so her[N]
being alive is more likely than you[N]
think. Don't give up hope yet, Father.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yes, of course. That I need to be[N]
consoled by my own son is a bit[N]
disgraceful, but still, thank you.[A]
[MidRight]
I'll find her, you can count on it[Beat][N]

Ha, there is no need to kneel.[N]
As you say, I am quite late.[A]
[FarRight]
My emperor, we've arrived as you[N]
requested[Beat] Who might this be?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, this is Coralia, my granddaughter.[N]
Of my potential successors, she holds[N]
much promise. I have high hopes for her.[A]
[FarLeft]
It is a pleasure to meet both of you.[N]
I have heard much about your exploits[N]
in Decia, Sir Elias. Or[Beat][AN]
Should I call you the Vermillion Knight?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Just Elias is fine, my lady. Our knightly[N]
titles are a bit embarrassing, to be frank.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Very well, Elias. And of course, my[N]
grandfather has spoken often of the[N]
Auric Lion, guardian of Cythes.[AN]
You have my greatest respect.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
I appreciate it, but I only do my[N]
duty in Orfeas's name. Nothing more.[A]
[Right]
So, uh[Beat] What did you want[N]
to tell me, Your Majesty?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, yes. I received a letter from Duke[N]
Cidor of Selese, requesting aid from[N]
Cythes in dealing with a few rebels.[AN]
They have evaded his grasp and caused[N]
him no end of problems, as he says it.[N]
What do you make of the situation?[A]
[Right]
The Decian Liberators are a resourceful[N]
group. That he struggles to end their[N]
threat, once and for all, is of no surprise.[A]
[Left]
Hmm[Beat] Why did he not send the letter to[N]
you, instead? You oversee the occupation,[N]
so surely a direct request was unnecessary.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I've met him before, but our[N]
acquaintance isn't a cordial one.[N]
Even if he is nominally on our side,[AN]
I've no respect for traitors. Perhaps[N]
he felt uncomfortable asking me himself.[A]
[Left]
Traitor he may be, but his cooperation[N]
with us greatly reduced the bloodshed[N]
necessary to cow Decia into submission.[AN]
His defeat would form a vacuum in the[N]
region that cannot be allowed. Elias,[N]
send as many troops as Cidor requires.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
[Beat]As you wish. Is that all, then?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. Perhaps this did not require a[N]
personal meeting, but I wanted to see how[N]
you have progressed since your induction.[AN]
Today, I see before me a fine knight,[N]
worthy of his accolades and place as[N]
youngest member of the Order of Iris.[A]
[Right]
I am humbled by your praise,[N]
my emperor, and I can only[N]
hope to live up to it.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I trust that you will. Now, I must[N]
attend another meeting. Coralia,[N]
you may return to your studies.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Yes, Grandfather.[A]
