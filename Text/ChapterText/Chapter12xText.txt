Hey there, commander. Name's Ellerey.[N]
I know a thing or two about smithing.[N]
My weapon and armor are even self-made![AN]
I'd like to tag along with you, since[N]
I never did like what Cidor was up to.[A]
[MidRight]
An armored knight, huh? We've had a[N]
couple join us already, but none[N]
with a preference for the lance.[AN]
I'll give it some thought.[A][X]

An armored knight, huh? We don't have[N]

attacking the hen cage.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
And that bloodied, worn axe of yours?[A]
[MidLeft]
Had to slaughter the hens before I left.[A]

A likely story[Beat] but we need extra[N]

Sir Loewe, I heard you may be traveling[N]
through the deserts of Mahemen. You see,[N]
I am in search of a certain plant.[AN]
I was wondering if I may join your ranks,[N]
as I have plenty of experience dealing[N]
with sand, so it won't slow me down.[AN]

are without equal.[AN]

my weapon of choice is the bow.[AN]

carry with you[Beat] No matter,[AN]
