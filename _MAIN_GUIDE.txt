Hello Team Distant Roads! This guide is written by Loog, and it's intended to be a tutorial on how to use this buildfile for people who are generally inexperienced with them. As such, I'll try to be as detailed as possible for each step.

For this main folder, there isn't much that you need to do here except run MAKE_HACK_full.cmd when you've finished making changes in the other folders. It writes all the changes we've made to FE8 each time it's run. Since this format is easily reversible, it seemed a better fit for a large group project where many ASM changes need to be made. Just make sure you have FE8_clean.gba in the same folder.

As for the rest of the guide, we're going to go in order of install (so if you look at ROMBuildfile.event, you'll see the order), which is Definitions -> Text -> Tables -> Graphics -> Music -> Engine Hacks -> Events -> Maps. Each folder will have a specific guide there that will be more in-depth, so just navigate to them and look at those for specific things.
